There is also a second paper describing a small re-design of the SEN12MS dataset for single-label and multi-label scene classification tasks, including benchmark results on state-of-the-art CNN architectures. It will also be published in the ISPRS Annals in July 2021. In the meantime, you can refer to the following arXiv pre-print:

## Contents
The repository contains the following folders:

### labels  
In this folder, text and pickle files containing single labels for every scene (patch) of SEN12MS are provided, following the IGBP land cover scheme. They can be used to train scene classification instead of semantic segmentation models. The class numbers of both the original IGBP scheme and the simplified IGBP scheme can be found in (Schmitt & Wu, 2021). 
- `single-label_IGBPfull_ClsNum`: This file contains scene labels based on the full IGBP land cover scheme, represented by actual class numbers.
- `single-label_IGBP_full_OneHot`: This file contains scene labels based on the full IGBP land cover scheme, represented by a one-hot vector encoding.
- `single-label_IGBPsimple_ClsNum`: This file contains scene labels based on the simplified IGBP land cover scheme, represented by actual class numbers.
- `single-label_IGBPsimple_OneHot`: This file contains scene labels based on the simplified IGBP land cover scheme, represented by a one-hot vector encoding.
All these files are available both in plain ASCII (.txt) format, as well as .pkl format. 

In addition, there is a list of multi-class labels for every scene:
- `IGBP_probability_labels.pkl`: This file contains scene labels based on the full IGBP land cover scheme, represented by the probability vectors. The probability vector shows the percentages of coverage of different classes in a scene/patch.

Please note: The python scripts provided in the `classification` folder of this repository only read probability labels in the original IGBP scheme (i.e. `IGBP_probability_labels.pkl`), and convert them into single-label/ multi-label in the simplified IGBP land cover scheme on the fly. The other files are intended for sake of convenience to be used with other frameworks.

### splits
In this folder, text files containing suggestions for splits are stored, pointing either at complete folders or individual files. Due to the folder structure and naming convention of SEN12MS, such file/folder list files should only point to Sentinel-1  or Sentinel-2 data (i.e. with the identifier `_s1_` or `_s2_`in folder and/or file name. After reading in such a file, the identifier can easily be replaced to `_s2_`, `_s1_` or `_lc_`, respectively, to address the corresponding Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1 or land cover data.  
Current split suggestions:
- `SEN12MS_holdOutScenes.txt`: this file contains scenes to form a hold-out dataset. The scenes were selected with great care to ensure that both the spatial and seasonal distributions are equal to the ones of the complete dataset. These hold-out scenes contain about 10% of all patches of the dataset.
- `train_list`: list of image patches used for training the scene classification models provided in this repository. All patches of this list are NOT contained in the above-mentioned set of hold-out scenes.  
Please note: One triplet was removed from this list, because the corresponding SAR patch was damaged. The removed file ID is `ROIs1868_summer_s1_146_p202`. The label still exists in the label files, as the corresponding Sentinel-2 data is not broken.
- `test_list`: list of image patches used for testing. These patches are all from the scenes defined in the hold-out set above.
- `val_list`: Not provided. Based on your individual considerations, you should extract a subset from the files in `train_list` to be used as validation set. This can be done, e.g., by random sampling, or by selecting specific patches from specific scenes using the SEN12MS file tree structure.

The file lists are available both in plain ASCII (.txt) format, as well as .pkl format, with the .pkl files being the ones that area read by the scripts provided in the `classification` folder of this repository.

### utils
In this folder, other utilities that can help to load, process, or analyze the data can be stored.
- `Sen12MSOverview.ipynb`: this notebook analyzes the class distribution of the whole SEN12MS dataset and plots the individual ROIs onto a world map

### classification  
In this folder, you can find codes for image classification CNNs (e.g. ResNet and DenseNet models) aiming at single-label and multi-label scene classification. They were developed using Python 3.7.7 and using several packages (NumPy, Rasterio, Scikit-Learn, TensorboardX, Torch, TorchVision, TQDM). To install the packages run `pip install requirements.txt` with your development environment activated from the `classification` folder.

The files needed for training and evaluating SEN12MS-based classification models are described as follows:
- `dataset.py`: This python script reads the data from SEN12MS and the probability label file. It converts the probability labels into single-label or multi-label annotations.
- `main_train.py`: This python script is used to train the model. It requires several input arguments to specify the scenario for training (e.g. label type, simplified/original IGBP scheme, models, learning rate etc.). Here is an example of the input arguments:  
`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 \  
python main_train.py \  
  --exp_name experiment_name \  
  --data_dir /work/share/sen12ms \  
  --label_split_dir /home/labels_splits \  
--use_RGB \  
  --IGBP_simple \  
  --label_type multi_label \  
  --threshold 0.1 \  
  --model DenseNet121 \  
  --lr 0.001\  
  --decay 1e-5 \  
  --batch_size 64 \  
  --num_workers 4 \  
  --epochs 100 \`  
These arguments will be saved into a .txt file automatically. This .txt file can be used in the testing for reading the arguments. The `threshold` parameter is used to filter out the labels with lower probabilities. Note that this threshold has no influence on single-label classification. More explanation of the arguments is in the `main_train.py` file. Note that the probability label file and the split lists should be put under the same folder during training and testing. The script reads .pkl format instead of .txt files.
- `test.py`: This python script is used to test the model. It is a semi-automatic script and reads the argument file generated in the training process to decide the label type, model type etc. However, it still requires user to input some basic arguments, such as the path of data directory. Here is an example of the input arguments:  
`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 \  
python test.py \  
  --config_file /home/single_DenseNet_RGB/logs/20201019_000519_arguments.txt \  
  --data_dir /work/share/sen12ms \  
  --label_split_dir /home/labels_splits \  
  --checkpoint_pth /home/major_DenseNet_RGB/checkpoints/20201019_000519_model_best.pth \  
  --batch_size 64 \  
  --num_workers 4 \`  
All other arguments will be read from the argument .txt file created when calling the training function.
- `metrics.py`: This script contains several metrics used to evaluate single-label/multi-label classification test results.
- `models/DenseNet.py`: This script contains several DenseNet models with different depth.
- `models/ResNet.py`: This script contains several ResNet models with different depth.
- `VGG.py`: This script contains VGG16 and VGG19 models. However, it is not used in the experiments.

Pre-trained weights and optimization parameters for these models can be downloaded from here: 
https://syncandshare.lrz.de/getlink/fiCDbqiiSFSNwot5exvUcW1y/trained_models. 

The models' respective input modalities are specified by their suffixes:
- `_RGB` means that only Sentinel-2 RGB imagery is used 
- `_s2` indicates that full multi-spectral Sentinel-2 data were used
- `_s1s2` represents data fusion-based models analyzing both Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data

### Semantic Segmentation
